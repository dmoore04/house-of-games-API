Scythe can be a lengthy game but really packs a punch if you put the time in. With beautiful artwork, countless scenarios and clever game mechanics, this board game is a must for any board game fanatic; just make sure you explain ALL the rules before you start playing with first timers or you may find they bring it up again and again.",
